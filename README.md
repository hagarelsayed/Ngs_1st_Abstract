 [1] Study Design: 
1- The study is to investigate coronavirus outbreak by Retrieval of the short read dataset 
2- Sub setting to produce 5 million reads 
3-Making alignment to an appropriate genome and generating Sam file. 
4- Selecting the reads that made secondary alignment 
5- Calculate the GC content and quality scores of such reads 

## Setting Environment

'sudo apt-get install sra-toolkit'

the past code didnt install , so used 
 sudo apt install sra-toolkit

gave an error 

at the begining data retrieval was by Search shor read archive (anient dna) then specifying it a bit then
Send results to run selector (for it to be filtered)

Revert to the old run selector

<setup environment>
conda activate ngs1



The following is test
# **First Trial**
## Setting Environment

`sudo apt-get install sra-toolkit`

The past code did not install toolkit , so used
